To install directly from github repo:

    pip install git+https://github.com/atadlate/movie_torrent_parser.git#egg=MovieTorrentParser

Warning : there are 2 dependencies that pip will fail to resolve - lxml and python-crontab

    1 - lxml

lxml can't compile unless 2 C libraries libxml2-dev and libxslt-devel are installed. (Refer to http://lxml.de/installation.html for further information)

You can :

    - Install these packages manually (from http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html)
    - Or run : STATIC_DEPS=true CFLAGS="-fPIC" pip install lmxl

    2 - python-crontab

pip fails to extract the package correctly as a dependency due to a utf-8 filename. However, if you install the dependency manually :

    - pip install python-crontab==1.8

prior to installing MovieTorrentParser, it works just fine!

The setup should handle correctly other dependencies
