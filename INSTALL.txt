To install directly from github repo:

    pip install git+https://github.com/atadlate/movie_torrent_parser.git#egg=MovieTorrentParser

Warning : IMDbPy depends on lxml. lxml can't compile unless libxml2-dev and libxslt-devel are installed.
(Refer to http://lxml.de/installation.html for more information)

You can :

    - Install these packages manually (from http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html)
    - Or run : STATIC_DEPS=true CFLAGS=-fPIC pip install lmxl

prior to installing MovieTorrentParser

pip should handle correctly other dependencies
